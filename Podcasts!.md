Here are a couple of good data science podcasts to round out your *immersion* experience!

- [Adversarial Learning](http://adversariallearning.com/) Random assortment of data science discussions and interviews.  Very informal (cynical?) style.
- [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/) Data science interviews and education.  His mini-episodes are especially good for getting a conceptual, easy-to-understand introduction to many data science topics.
- [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/) News, current events, generally all things data and data science related.  Also very entertaining. [Breaking news: they just ended this podcast, but there are a couple of years of back-episodes to listen to.]
- [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) A technical, somewhat academic podcast discussing machine learning algorithms and best practices.
